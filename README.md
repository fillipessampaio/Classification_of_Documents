## 1. Business objectives

<p> Avoid misclassifications in stored legal documents. </p>

## 2. Assess situation

<p> A public manager needs to ensure that all documents stored by employees are correctly classified to avoid future problems with the collection. Dealing with the difficulty of checking each document, there is a need for a tool to indicate possible misclassifications. For this, a sample of the collection of documents was given with their due classifications. </p>

## 3. Project goals

<p> This project intends to build a document classifier model with Natural Language Processing using machine learning algorithms. </p>

## 4. Solution 

<p> At the end, a machine learning model based on XGBClassifier was built with a 83% of accuracy. This does not guarantee classification of all documents but may indicate possible classification errors. </p>
